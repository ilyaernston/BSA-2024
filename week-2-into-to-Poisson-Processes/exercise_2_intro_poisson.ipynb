    "The binomial distribution describes the probability of obtaining a certain number of successes in a series of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes: success or failure. \n",

    "Let $ X $ represent the total number of successes in $ n $ trials. We want to find $ E[X] $, the expected number of successes after $ n $ trials. The variable $ X $ can take any integer value from 0 to $ n $, representing the number of successes. We compute the expected value of $ X $ by definition, as the sum of all possible values of $ X $ weighted by their probabilities:\n",

To do so, we count the number of ways to achieve exactly $ k $ successes in $ n $ trials and then multiply by the probability of any one of these outcomes occurring. Each specific arrangement of $ k $ successes and $ n - k $ failures corresponds to a sequence of successes and failures. For example, if $ n = 3 $ and $ k = 2 $, one possible sequence is $ SSF $ (two successes followed by one failure). The number of ways to arrange $ k $ successes in $ n $ trials is given by the binomial coefficient:\n",

    "Suppose now that you are a neuroscientist trying to determine the expected number of times that a neuron fires in a given time period (for example, in a single hour). A logical first approach would be to treat the spikes of the neuron as a binomial random variable, take the expected value of this random variable (which we just derived), and break apart the hour into subsets such that each time subset is a single trial. For example, we may say that each minute in the hour is a single trial, and then calculate the expected number of spikes by obtaining the probability that a neuron spikes in a single minute and multiplying it by 60 minutes in an hour:\n",

    "\n",
    "This might serve well as an initial approximation. However, what if a neuron, on average, fires more than once per minute (a likely situation, given the firing dynamics of most neurons). Perhaps we should make our expression more granular. What if instead of defining a single trial as a single minute, we define a single trial as a single second? This would result in the following expression for calculating the expected number of spikes:\n",

    "This would very likely be a better approximation for the expected number of spikes the neuron will exhibit. However, will it be a perfect calculation? What if the neuron, on average, spikes more than once per second? In fact, what if the neuron spikes more than once per second even only sometimes? We may very well be tempted to answer: \"let's simply get more granular!\", and derive the expected number of spikes per millisecond interval, or even nanosecond interval. In fact, we could continue getting more granular ad infinetum. Perhaps, however, we could derive an expression for calculating the expected number of spikes as the interval of time defining each trial approaches an infinitely small value? (spoiler: this is exactly what we will do).\n",

And this is interesting, because often times you will simply be presented with the formula for the poisson distribution without being shown where it comes from, and you can simply plug in the numbers and use it. But it is truly neat to know that the poisson distribution is simply the binomial distribution taken to its limit."

    "We now have all the tools and background we need to derive the Poisson Distribution. To remind ourselves, we are a neuroscientist studying a spiking neuron (a random variable). We have observed this neuron for hours on end, and we found a pretty decent expected value for the number of spikes the neuron will exhibit in an hour, which we define as $\\lambda$: $E(\\text{spikes}) = \\lambda$. We stated that we want to model this expected value as a binomial distribution, and so we define: \n",

    "Where $n$ is a single trial. And to remind ourselves again, we could view a trial as some subset of the total amount of time we are measuring spikes in. So $\\lambda$ would be the total number of spikes in an hour, and $n$ would be some subset of an hour. We then wanted to take the limit as $n$ approaches infinity, to get the most accurate estimate of the number of spikes, and avoid mistakes that would arise from a neuron that spikes more than once in any non-infinitesimally-small period of time. To evaluate the limit as $n \\rightarrow \\inf$, we begin as follows: \n",

Since $E(\\text{spikes}) = \\lambda = n*p$, the probability of success is thus: $p_{\\text{success}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{n}$. Since we are interested in the probability of $k$ successes, we must raise this probability to the $k$-th power. We also have to multiply the expression by the probability of failure, which is simply $p_{\\text{failure}} = 1- \\frac{\\lambda}{n}$.

However, it is far more useful and far more beautiful to understand the tools you are using. That way, when you look at the results they output, you will have a much deeper intuition for what those results actually mean. Additionally, you will be more likely to use the tools correctly, and spot mistakes when they are used incorrectly. Finally, the joy of understanding these beautiful expressions is a worthy goal inof itself, and will add much color and happiness to your life as an academic, scientist, and technologist."

    "\n",
    "2. **Poisson Probability Calculation**:\n",

    "   - It handles invalid cases, such as negative $ k $ or $ \\lambda $, by returning a probability of 0 in such cases.\n",

    "   - We test the function with $ \\lambda = 2.5 $ and $ k = 3 $, calculating the probability of observing exactly 3 events when the average rate is 2.5 events.\n"

    "### Calculating the Cumulative Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, we define a function `cumulative_poisson_probability(lmbda, n)` to calculate the cumulative probability of observing up to $ n $ events, which is the sum of probabilities for all event counts from 0 to $ n $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Summing Probabilities**:\n",
    "   - The function calculates the cumulative probability by summing $ P(k; \\lambda) $ for $ k = 0 $ to $ k = n $.\n",
    "   - It calls the `poisson_probability(lmbda, k)` function (from Question 1) to compute each individual probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Return the Result**:\n",
    "   - The cumulative probability is returned as the sum of all individual probabilities from $ k = 0 $ to $ k = n $.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing**:\n",
    "   - We test the function with $ \\lambda = 3 $ and $ n = 5 $, which calculates the probability of observing at most 5 events when the average rate is 3.\n",
    "   - This cumulative probability helps us understand the likelihood of seeing no more than a certain number of events in a Poisson process."
