    "\n",
    "   A neuroscientist is studying the firing patterns of a certain type of neuron in the brain. The average firing rate of these neurons is found to be 5 spikes per second. Assuming that the spike train of these neurons can be modeled as a Poisson process:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) What is the probability that the neuron fires exactly 10 times in a 2-second interval?\n",
    "\n",
    "   b) Calculate the probability that the neuron fires at least once within a 0.1-second interval.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- For all programming tasks, ensure that your code is well-commented to explain your logic and approach.\n",
    "- Make sure to handle edge cases, such as negative values of $\\lambda$ or $k$, appropriately in your functions.\n",
    "- In Question 2, if you're unfamiliar with plotting libraries, focus on generating the probabilities and understanding the distribution's shape through the output values before attempting to plot.\n",

    "#### Question 1: Implementing the Poisson Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Write a program to manually calculate the probability of observing a given number of events $k$ in a fixed interval, given the average rate of occurrences $\\lambda$, using the Poisson formula. You are not allowed to use any external libraries that directly compute Poisson probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "1. Your program should define a function `poisson_probability(lambda, k)` that takes the average rate $\\lambda$ and the desired number of occurrences $k$ as inputs.\n",
    "2. The function should use the Poisson formula:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "3. Calculate $k!$ (factorial of $k$) using a loop or recursive function.\n",
    "4. Return the probability of observing exactly $k$ events.\n",
    "5. Test your function by calculating the probability of observing 3 events for $\\lambda = 2.5$."
