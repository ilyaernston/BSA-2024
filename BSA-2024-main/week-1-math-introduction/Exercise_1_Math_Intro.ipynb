    "In calculus, the derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable. Intuitively, it tells us how a function's output changes as its input changes. This concept is essential for understanding how quantities change in response to one another and forms the foundation of calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $h$ represents a very small change in $ x $. The derivative $ f'(x) $ measures the slope of the tangent line to the curve of $ f(x) $ at that particular point. If $ f(x) $ represents position as a function of time, $ f'(x) $ gives the velocity — the rate at which position changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative is fundamentally about finding instantaneous rates of change. Unlike average rates, which calculate changes over a finite interval, the derivative captures the rate of change at a specific instant by making the interval $ h $ infinitesimally small. This concept is central to many fields, as it allows us to precisely measure how variables interact in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Derivative of a Polynomial Function\n",
    "\n",
    "For polynomial functions, there's a general formula for finding derivatives that simplifies the process. For a polynomial function $ f(x) = x^n $, the derivative is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule tells us that to differentiate a power of $ x $:\n",
    "1. Multiply by the exponent $ n $.\n",
    "2. Decrease the exponent by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $ f(x) = x^3 $:\n",
    "1. Bring down the exponent: $ 3 \\cdot x $.\n",
    "2. Subtract one from the exponent: $ 3x^{3-1} = 3x^2 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the derivative of $ x^3 $ with respect to $ x $ is $ 3x^2 $. This rule works because of the nature of polynomial growth: as the power increases, the function grows faster, and the derivative captures the rate of this growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Derivatives of Constant Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants in a function do not change as $ x $ changes, meaning their rate of change is zero. Thus, the derivative of any constant term $ C $ is zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d}{dx}C = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This property aligns with our intuition: a constant does not affect the slope of the function, so its contribution to the rate of change is null.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linearity of Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the essential properties of derivatives is **linearity**, meaning the derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their derivatives, and the derivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the derivative of the function:\n",
    "1. $ \\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x) $\n",
    "2. $ \\frac{d}{dx} [c \\cdot f(x)] = c \\cdot f'(x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "This property allows us to work with complex functions by breaking them into simpler parts. For example, if $ f(x) = 3x^3 + 2x $, the derivative is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f'(x) = 3 \\cdot 3x^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 = 9x^2 + 2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Derivative as a Tool for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Derivatives provide insight into the behavior of functions:\n",
    "- **Positive derivative**: the function is increasing at that point.\n",
    "- **Negative derivative**: the function is decreasing.\n",
    "- **Zero derivative**: the function has a critical point, possibly a maximum, minimum, or point of inflection."

    "An **antiderivative** (or indefinite integral) is essentially the reverse operation of differentiation. While a derivative provides the rate of change of a function, an antiderivative seeks to retrieve the original function from its rate of change. In this sense, finding an antiderivative can be thought of as \"undoing\" the derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a function $ f(x) $, an antiderivative of $ f(x) $ is a function $ F(x) $ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F'(x) = f(x)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the derivative of $ F(x) $ gives us back $ f(x) $. The general notation for an antiderivative, or indefinite integral, of $ f(x) $ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int f(x) \\, dx = F(x) + C\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ C $ is a constant known as the **constant of integration**. This constant accounts for the fact that multiple functions can have the same derivative; any constant added to $ F(x) $ would vanish when differentiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "While derivatives measure instantaneous rates of change, antiderivatives allow us to reconstruct an original function from knowledge of its rate of change. This is particularly useful in physics, engineering, and other applied sciences. For instance, if we know the velocity (rate of change of position) of an object, we can use an antiderivative to determine its position function over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The General Formula for Polynomial Antiderivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "For polynomial functions, there is a straightforward rule to compute antiderivatives. If $ f(x) = x^n $, the antiderivative of $ f(x) $ is:\n",

    "  \\int x^3 \\, dx = \\frac{x^{4}}{4} + C\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule works for any polynomial term as long as the exponent $ n $ is not -1, because dividing by zero would make the expression undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constants and the Constant of Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "When computing an antiderivative, constants play an essential role. Since the derivative of any constant is zero, any function that differs by only a constant will have the same derivative. This is why we add $ + C $ in the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int f(x) \\, dx = F(x) + C\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $ C $ accounts for the unknown original constant that might have been part of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linearity of Indefinite Integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "Antiderivatives, like derivatives, are **linear**, meaning:\n",
    "1. $ \\int [f(x) + g(x)] \\, dx = \\int f(x) \\, dx + \\int g(x) \\, dx $\n",
    "2. $ \\int c \\cdot f(x) \\, dx = c \\cdot \\int f(x) \\, dx $\n",
    "\n",
    "This property allows us to evaluate integrals of more complex functions by separating them into simpler components. For instance, if $ f(x) = 3x^2 + 5x $, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int (3x^2 + 5x) \\, dx = 3 \\int x^2 \\, dx + 5 \\int x \\, dx = x^3 + \\frac{5x^2}{2} + C\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special Case: $ x^{-1} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The antiderivative rule for powers does not apply when $ n = -1 $, as this would involve division by zero. Instead, for $ f(x) = x^{-1} = \\frac{1}{x} $, the antiderivative is:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\int \\frac{1}{x} \\, dx = \\ln |x| + C\n",

    "While an antiderivative, or indefinite integral, represents a general family of functions, a **definite integral** calculates a specific value: the accumulated area under a curve over a given interval. Definite integrals are powerful tools in calculus for finding areas, volumes, and other cumulative measures of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summation and the Concept of Area Under a Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand definite integrals, it's useful to begin with **summation**, which can approximate the area under a curve. Imagine dividing the interval $[a, b]$ of a function $ f(x) $ into smaller sub-intervals and approximating the area beneath $ f(x) $ with rectangles. Each rectangle’s height is given by the function value at a specific point within the interval, and its width is the length of the sub-interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of sub-intervals increases (and their width becomes infinitesimally small), the summation of these rectangles’ areas approaches the actual area under $ f(x) $. This idea leads to the **definite integral**, which calculates the exact area in the limit as the number of rectangles approaches infinity and their width approaches zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition of a Definite Integral\n",
    "\n",
    "The definite integral of $ f(x) $ from $ a $ to $ b $ is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \\Delta x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ \\Delta x $ is the width of each sub-interval.\n",
    "- $ x_i $ is a sample point within each sub-interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definite integral gives us the exact \"net area\" under $ f(x) $ from $ a $ to $ b $, taking into account areas below the x-axis as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** connects definite integrals with antiderivatives. It states:\n",
    "1. **First Part**: If $ F(x) $ is an antiderivative of $ f(x) $ on $[a, b]$, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = F(b) - F(a)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   This means that to evaluate a definite integral, we find an antiderivative $ F(x) $ of $ f(x) $ and then subtract $ F(a) $ from $ F(b) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second Part**: The derivative of the integral function $ G(x) = \\int_a^x f(t) \\, dt $ is simply $ f(x) $. This confirms that differentiation and integration are inverse operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theorem provides a method for calculating definite integrals quickly by finding the antiderivative rather than using limits and summation directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties of Definite Integrals\n",

    "Definite integrals have several key properties that make them useful in various applications:\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: \n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",

    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = \\int_a^c f(x) \\, dx + \\int_c^b f(x) \\, dx\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   This property allows us to split integrals over contiguous intervals.\n",

    "     \\int_{-a}^a f(x) \\, dx = 0\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   These properties simplify computations for symmetric functions over symmetric intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreting the Result of a Definite Integral\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a definite integral represents the **net area** under the curve. If $ f(x) $ is positive over $[a, b]$, the integral gives the total area between $ f(x) $ and the x-axis. If $ f(x) $ is negative over part of the interval, the integral subtracts that area, resulting in a net area calculation that accounts for both positive and negative regions.\n",

    "#### Understanding Matrices\n",

    "#### Fundamental Concepts in Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experiment**: An action or process that results in an outcome, such as flipping a coin or rolling a die.\n",
    "2. **Sample Space (S)**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, the sample space for a coin flip is $ S = \\{ \\text{Heads}, \\text{Tails} \\} $.\n",
    "3. **Event**: A subset of the sample space. For example, getting a head in a coin flip is an event within the sample space $ S $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability of an Event\n",
    "\n",
    "The **probability** of an event $ A $, denoted $ P(A) $, is a measure of the likelihood that $ A $ occurs, satisfying:\n",
    "- $ 0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1 $: Probability is always between 0 (impossible) and 1 (certain).\n",
    "- **Sum Rule**: For a sample space $ S $, $ P(S) = 1 $.\n",
    "- **Complement Rule**: The probability of the complement of $ A $ (i.e., $ A $ not happening) is $ P(\\neg A) = 1 - P(A) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "For equally likely outcomes, the probability of an event $ A $ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes for } A}{\\text{Total number of outcomes in } S}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional probability** quantifies the probability of an event $ A $ occurring given that another event $ B $ has occurred. This is denoted $ P(A | B) $ and defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ P(A \\cap B) $ is the probability that both $ A $ and $ B $ occur. Conditional probability is useful for updating beliefs in light of new evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Independence of Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Two events $ A $ and $ B $ are **independent** if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, $ A $ and $ B $ are independent if:\n",

    "- $ P(A) $ is the **prior probability** of $ A $: our initial belief about $ A $ before observing $ B $.\n",
    "- $ P(B) $ is the **marginal probability** of $ B $: the total probability of $ B $ occurring under all possible scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are testing for a rare disease. Let:\n",
    "- $ A $ be the event \"person has the disease\".\n",
    "- $ B $ be the event \"test is positive\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If:\n",
    "- $ P(A) = 0.001 $ (1 in 1,000 people have the disease),\n",
    "- $ P(B | A) = 0.99 $ (the test is 99% accurate when the disease is present),\n",
    "- $ P(B | \\neg A) = 0.05 $ (5% false positive rate when the disease is not present),\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "#### Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A **random variable** is a numerical outcome of a random process. Random variables can be:\n",

    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  The standard deviation $ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(X)} $ provides the average deviation of $ X $ from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Probability Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binomial Distribution**: Represents the number of successes in $ n $ independent yes/no trials, each with probability $ p $ of success. The probability of $ k $ successes is:\n",

    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   f(x | \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}\n",
